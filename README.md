I’m a second-year engineering student passionate about building
              projects that blend creativity and problem-solving. My interests
              span across web development, data structures & algorithms, and
              embedded systems, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies to
              sharpen my skills. Right now, I’m working on projects ranging from
              sustainability solutions to fun applications with ESP32-based IoT builds. Alongside academics, I’m
              actively preparing for internships , aiming to gain hands-on experience and contribute to
              impactful projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy experimenting with
              ideas, turning small sparks into real-world prototypes, and
              learning by building.
